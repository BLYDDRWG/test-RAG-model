SECTION 3: COMBINED ASSESSMENT FINDINGS
=====================================

Primary Finding | Secondary Finding | Tertiary Finding | Integrated Approach
-------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------
Poor VO2 Max | Upper Cross Syndrome | Limited Ankle Dorsiflexion | Begin with posture and mobility work, delay cardio intensity
Limited Hip Mobility | Poor Core Stability | Fair Cardiovascular Fitness | Focus on hip-core integration before increasing cardio demands
Good Cardiovascular Fitness | Shoulder Impingement | Limited Thoracic Mobility | Maintain cardio while addressing upper quarter dysfunction
Scapular Winging | Low Stroke Efficiency (Concept 2) | Forward Head Posture | Focus on scapular mechanics before intensive rowing training
Excessive Forward Lean (Squat) | Flat Back Posture | Poor Pacing (Cooper) | Address postural foundations before increasing cardiovascular load
Lower Cross Syndrome | Asymmetrical Weight Shift (Push-up) | Average VO2 Max | Begin with pelvic alignment before progressing to symmetrical loading patterns
Limited Hip IR | Feet Turn Out (Squat) | Power Drop-off (Concept 2) | Focus on hip mobility/mechanics before power development

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
- Reassess critical movement patterns every 2 weeks
- Reassess cardiovascular metrics every 4-6 weeks
- Progress to next programming phase when achieving 80% of mobility/stability goals
- Adjust training intensity based on heart rate and RPE responses to previous sessions
- Integrate corrective exercises into each training session as part of warm-up or recovery
- For asymmetrical findings, compare left/right differences after 4 weeks of intervention
- Document subjective feedback alongside objective measurements to track perceived improvements
