RAG EVALUATION QUERIES
====================

CARDIOVASCULAR ASSESSMENT QUERIES:
1. "What interventions should I implement for a 25-year-old male with a VO2 max of 22 ml/kg/min from the Rockport Walk Test?"
2. "My client has a consistently high heart rate response during the Rockport Walk Test despite moderate effort. What programming approach is best?"
3. "A 32-year-old female client completed the Cooper 12-minute test but showed poor pacing with significant slowing in the final 4 minutes. What intervention should I prioritize?"
4. "What's the appropriate programming for a client with fair range performance (1.2 miles) on the Cooper 12-minute test?"
5. "My client shows inconsistent split times on the Concept 2 rower with good power but poor technique. What's the recommended approach?"

POSTURE AND MOVEMENT ASSESSMENT QUERIES:
1. "What corrective strategy should I use for a client presenting with classic upper cross syndrome?"
2. "My client shows excessive forward lean during squat assessment. What interventions and programming modifications are appropriate?"
3. "During push-up assessment, my client demonstrates lower back sagging after only 3 repetitions. What should I prioritize in their program?"
4. "Assessment shows limited hip internal rotation with compensatory movement patterns. What's the best intervention sequence?"
5. "My client has forward head posture and scapular winging. Which issue should I address first and what exercises should I include?"

COMBINED ASSESSMENT QUERIES:
1. "My client has poor cardiovascular fitness (VO2 max in poor range), upper cross syndrome, and limited ankle dorsiflexion. How should I structure their initial programming?"
2. "Assessment results show good cardiovascular fitness but shoulder impingement and limited thoracic mobility. What's the most appropriate integrated approach?"
3. "What's the best programming strategy for a client with lower cross syndrome who also demonstrates asymmetrical weight shift during push-ups and has average VO2 max?"
4. "My client shows limited hip internal rotation, feet turning out during squats, and power drop-off during rowing tests. How should I prioritize interventions?"

SITUATIONAL ADAPTATION QUERIES:
1. "How should the programming approach for upper cross syndrome be modified for a beginner versus an advanced client?"
2. "What modifications should I make to cardiovascular programming for a client with poor recovery rate if they're training for rehabilitation versus performance?"
3. "How frequently should I reassess movement patterns for a client with multiple postural issues, and what metrics indicate successful intervention?"
