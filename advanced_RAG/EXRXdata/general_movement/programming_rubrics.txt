Implementation Guidelines
    Training Session Structure
    Warm-up: 5-10 minutes progressive movement preparation
    Skill/Technical Work: 10-15 minutes (5×5 patterns typically placed here)
    Main Work: 20-30 minutes (primary training emphasis with appropriate set/rep scheme)
    Accessory Work: 0-10 minutes (goal-specific supplementary exercises)
    Cool-down: 5 minutes recovery-focused activity

Recovery Management
    Beginners: 48-72 hours between similar movement patterns
    Intermediates: 24-48 hours between similar high-intensity patterns
    Deload Frequency: Last week of each mesocycle (reduced volume or intensity)
    Progression Metrics
    Beginners: Primary focus on movement quality and volume tolerance
    Intermediates: Balanced consideration of volume, intensity, and performance metrics
    All Levels: Regular assessment of subjective effort to ensure appropriate progression

This comprehensive framework provides a structured approach to program design while maintaining 
flexibility for individual needs and responses across different training objectives.
