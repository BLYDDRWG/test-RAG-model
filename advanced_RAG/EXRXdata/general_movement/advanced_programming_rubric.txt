Advanced Training Program Descriptions

    Wendler 5/3/1 Program
    Program Overview
    Wendler 5/3/1 is a percentage-based, submaximal training program developed by Jim Wendler focused on long-term strength development through progressive overload. It emphasizes gradual progression, sustainability, and autoregulation through AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) sets.

        Core Principles
        Training based on percentage of Training Max (TM), typically 90% of true 1RM
        Progressive cycles with prescribed percentages and rep schemes
        AMRAP sets for autoregulation and progressive overload
        Emphasis on compound movements: Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift, Overhead Press
        Assistance work customized to individual needs

    French Contrast Method
    Program Overview
    The French Contrast Method is an advanced training protocol that combines complex and contrast training methodologies to develop explosive strength, reactive ability, and power output. This method leverages post-activation potentiation (PAP) by strategically sequencing exercises with varying force-velocity characteristics.

        Core Principles
        Integration of four distinct loading parameters within a single complex
        Sequential performance from heavy strength to explosive plyometrics
        Minimal rest between exercises within a complex
        Complete recovery between complexes
        Emphasis on neurological adaptations and rate of force development
        Standard Complex Structure
        Each French Contrast complex consists of four sequential exercises:

        Exercise 1: Heavy Compound Lift (Strength Stimulus)
            85-95% 1RM for 1-3 reps
            Focus: Maximum recruitment of high-threshold motor units
            Example: Back Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press
        Exercise 2: Plyometric Movement (Explosive Response)
            Bodyweight or light load for 3-5 reps
            Focus: Maximum rate of force development
            Example: Squat Jump, Broad Jump, Plyo Push-up
        Exercise 3: Weighted Explosive Movement (Strength-Speed)
            30-40% 1RM for 5-8 reps
            Focus: Power production with external resistance
            Example: Weighted Jump Squat, Speed Deadlift, Medicine Ball Throw
        Exercise 4: Assisted/Accelerated Plyometric (Speed-Strength)
            Bodyweight or assisted for 5-8 reps
            Focus: Maximum movement velocity
            Example: Band-assisted Jumps, Downhill Sprints, Drop Jumps

    Flexible Implementation Guidelines
        4-week mesocycle pattern can be adjusted to 3 weeks with compressed progressions for in-season maintenance
        Exercise selection should emphasize movement patterns relevant to sport demands
        Conditioning protocols should match energy system requirements of the specific sport
        In-season programming requires reduced volume (typically 50-60% of off-season) with maintained intensity
        Monitoring through readiness assessments, RPE, and performance metrics guides weekly adjustments
