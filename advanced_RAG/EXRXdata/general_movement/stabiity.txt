Stability Development Protocol

General Stability Framework
Stability represents the foundation of all movement quality, defined as the ability to maintain optimal joint position during 
both static postures and dynamic movements. 

True stability encompasses:

    Neuromuscular control: Proper timing and recruitment of stabilizing muscles
    Motor pattern efficiency: Energy-efficient movement with minimal compensation
    Joint centration: Optimal positioning of joint surfaces during movement
    Force absorption and distribution: Proper management of external forces

This protocol divides the body into three interconnected yet distinct stability systems, each requiring targeted development.

Shoulder Girdle Stability Protocol
    Key Stabilization Principles
    Scapular positioning and control precedes glenohumeral stability
    Cervical spine alignment impacts upper quadrant function
    Rotator cuff functions primarily as a stabilizer, not prime mover
    Serratus anterior activation crucial for scapulohumeral rhythm
    Proper thoracic mobility supports optimal shoulder function
