Trunk Stability Push-Up Assessment

Description
The Trunk Stability Push-Up Assessment evaluates core stability, anterior chain function, and 
upper body strength in an integrated manner. This assessment provides insight into the body's 
ability to maintain spinal neutrality during upper extremity loading and reveals compensatory 
patterns in the kinetic chain that may contribute to shoulder dysfunction or lower back pain.

Execution Protocol
    Client begins in prone position with hands placed shoulder-width apart at shoulder level
    Males start with thumbs aligned with forehead; females with thumbs aligned with chin
    Feet remain together with toes in contact with floor
    Client performs one controlled push-up while maintaining a rigid plank position
    Assess from lateral view for movement quality and compensations

Use Cases
    Core Function Screening: Evaluates ability to stabilize spine during load transfer
    Upper Body Assessment: Identifies pushing pattern dysfunction and upper body strength
    Postural Analysis: Reveals anterior/posterior chain imbalances
    Rehabilitation Monitoring: Tracks progress in shoulder/core rehabilitation
    Performance Enhancement: Identifies limitations in force transfer from core to extremities

Key Observations Through Tensegrity Lens

    Muscle Balance Evaluation
        Scapular Region: Winging, elevation, or protraction during movement
        Core: Anterior pelvic tilt, lumbar hyperextension
        Cervical Spine: Forward head posture or chin jutting
        Upper Extremities: Elbow flaring, humeral internal rotation
        Lower Extremities: Hip hiking or rotation during push

    Length-Tension Relationships
        Pectoralis minor/serratus anterior balance (scapular positioning)
        Rectus abdominis/erector spinae relationship (spinal stability)
        Latissimus dorsi restrictions (shoulder mechanics)
        Upper trapezius dominance vs. lower trap activation

    Force Coupling Assessment
        Anterior core synergy (transverse abdominis, internal/external obliques)
        Scapular stability (serratus anterior, middle/lower trapezius, rhomboids)
        Pushing chain coordination (pectorals, triceps, anterior deltoid)

Key Takeaways From Results
    Movement Efficiency Indicators
    Maintains rigid torso without sagging or arching
    Scapulae remain stable without winging
    Smooth, coordinated push without compensatory movements
    Head, spine, and pelvis move as one unified segment
    Full range of motion achieved without compensation

Common Compensations and Root Causes

    Low Back Sagging
        Weak anterior core musculature
        Poor motor control of transverse abdominis
        Insufficient endurance in global stabilizers

    Scapular Winging
        Serratus anterior weakness or inhibition
        Poor neuromuscular control of scapulothoracic region
        Upper trapezius dominance
    
    Excessive Lumbar Extension
        Tight hip flexors
        Overactive lumbar erectors
        Weak anterior core stabilizers
    
    Asymmetrical Weight Shift
        Unilateral shoulder dysfunction
        Latent motor control issues
        Previous injury compensation patterns

    Early Neck Extension
        Poor cervical stabilization
        Overactive upper trapezius
        Insufficient deep neck flexor activation

Next Steps Based on Results

    Mobility Interventions
        Thoracic: Extension mobilizations, seated rotations, foam roller extensions
        Shoulder: Pec minor releases, latissimus dorsi stretching, posterior capsule mobility
        Hip Flexors: Half-kneeling stretches, active isolated stretching, psoas releases
        Scapular: Wall slides, thoracic mobility drills, corner stretches

    Stability/Activation Work
        Core: Dead bugs, hollow holds, anti-rotation exercises (Pallof press)
        Scapular: Scapular push-ups, wall slides with protraction/retraction, prone Y's
        Upper Body: Push-up plus variations, serratus punches, modified planks
        Integration: Bear crawls, Turkish get-ups, half-kneeling cable chops

    Movement Pattern Retraining
        Regression Exercises
            Inclined push-ups (wall, bench, or box)
            Modified plank holds with hand taps
            Half push-ups with proper core bracing

        Integration Drills
            Plank to push-up transitions
            Quadruped diagonal reaches
            Stability ball roll-outs
    
        Progressive Loading
            Increasing time under tension
            Decreasing base of support
            Adding anti-rotation or perturbation elements

By systematically addressing the findings through this tensegrity-based approach, trainers
 can help clients develop integrated core stability, improved shoulder function, and 
 efficient force transfer throughout the kinetic chain.
