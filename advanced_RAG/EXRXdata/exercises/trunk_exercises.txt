Programming Guidelines
    Exercise Selection Principles:
        1. Movement Balance: Include flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral components
        2. Anti-Movement Focus: Emphasize stability before mobility patterns
        3. Breathing Integration: Coordinate respiration with appropriate bracing
        4. Progressive Challenge: Systematic increase in stability demands before complexity
        5. Functional Transfer: Ensure trunk training complements primary movement goals

    Training Volume Recommendations:
        Stabilization Focus: 5-8 exercises, 2-3 sets of 5-10 reps with 2-5 second holds
        Strength Focus: 4-6 exercises, 3-4 sets of 6-12 reps at appropriate load
        Endurance Focus: 3-5 exercises, 2-3 sets of 15-30 second holds or 15-20+ reps
        Weekly Volume: 2-3 dedicated trunk sessions plus integration in main workouts

    Exercise Order Strategy:
        Anti-Movement First: Begin with stability challenges before dynamic work
        Compound Integration: Progress to multi-joint patterns involving trunk
        Positional Variety: Include exercises in various body positions (standing, kneeling, supine, prone)
        Fatigue Management: Place precision movements early in session
        Breathing Reset: Include respiratory focus between demanding segments
