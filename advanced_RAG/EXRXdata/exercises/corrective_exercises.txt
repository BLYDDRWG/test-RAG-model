Implementation Guidelines
    Exercise Selection Principles
        Assessment-Based: Choose exercises that directly address identified dysfunctions
        Sequence Appropriately: Move from isolation to integration
        Dose Properly: Begin with low volume (5-8 reps, 1-2 sets) focusing on quality
        Progress Strategically: Advance through stability-mobility continuum as control improves
        Monitor Response: Adjust based on movement quality improvements
    Programming Integration
        Warm-Up Application: 3-5 targeted exercises for 1 set each
        Dedicated Corrective Session: 6-8 exercises for 2-3 sets, performed 1-2× weekly
        Movement Preparation: 3-4 exercises immediately before related functional training
        Superset Strategy: Pair corrective work with complementary strength exercises
        Daily Movement Practice: Assign 1-2 key exercises for daily practice between sessions
    Exercise Prescription Guidelines
        Activation Work: 5-10 reps with 2-3 second holds
        Mobility Development: 6-8 reps with controlled movement through range
        Stabilization: 3-5 reps with 5-10 second holds
        Integration Patterns: 6-10 reps with emphasis on coordination
        Recovery Between Sets: 30-60 seconds for optimal motor learning

This comprehensive corrective exercise library provides targeted interventions for each major joint system while 
explicitly addressing the critical connections between these systems. Implementation should follow a progressive 
model based on individual assessment findings and movement quality responses.
