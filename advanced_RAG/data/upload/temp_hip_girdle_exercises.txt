Secondary Hip Integration Exercises
    Hip-Core Integration:
        Deadbug Variations: Supine core stabilization with controlled leg movement (integrates hip girdle with core)
        Bird-Dog: Quadruped opposite arm/leg raises maintaining pelvic position (integrates hip girdle with core)
        Side Plank with Hip Abduction: Lateral plank while lifting top leg (integrates hip girdle with core)
        Stir-the-Pot: Maintaining hip position in plank on stability ball with circular arm movement (integrates hip girdle with core)
        Suitcase Carry: Asymmetrically loaded walking with anti-lateral flexion focus (integrates hip girdle with core)

    Hip-Shoulder Integration:
        Farmer's Carry: Bilateral loaded walking with upright posture (integrates hip girdle with shoulder girdle)
        Overhead Walking Lunge: Split stance pattern while supporting weight overhead (integrates hip girdle with shoulder girdle)
        Turkish Get-Up: Floor-to-standing movement sequence maintaining overhead weight (integrates hip girdle with shoulder girdle)
        Medicine Ball Slam: Overhead to ground explosive movement (integrates hip girdle with shoulder girdle)
        Single-Arm Overhead Lunge: Asymmetrical load-bearing lunge pattern (integrates hip girdle with shoulder girdle)

    Full Body Integration:
        Clean: Olympic-style pull from floor to front rack position
        Snatch: Single-movement Olympic lift from floor to overhead
        Thruster: Front squat into overhead press in fluid movement
        Burpee: Floor-to-standing movement combining squat, plank, and jump
        Kettlebell Turkish Get-Up: Complex movement sequence maintaining weight overhead from supine to standing
        Man Maker: Combination of push-up and renegade row followed by squat and overhead press

Specialized Training Methods
    Pre-Exhaustion Techniques:
        Hip Abduction to Squat: Isolation movement followed by compound lower body exercise
        Glute Bridge to Hip Thrust: Bodyweight activation before loaded hip extension
        Banded Monster Walk to Lunge: Band resistance movement preceding compound exercise

    Post-Exhaustion Techniques:
        Squat to Split Squat: Bilateral movement followed by unilateral burnout
        Deadlift to Back Extension: Heavy compound pull followed by posterior chain isolation
        Leg Press to Bodyweight Squat: Machine-based loading followed by metabolic bodyweight work

    Time Under Tension Methods:
        Tempo Squat: Controlled movement with prescribed eccentric/isometric/concentric timing
        Pause Deadlift: Strategic pauses at knee height or mid-shin during pull
        1.5 Rep Squats: Full repetition plus half repetition counted as single unit
        Isometric Split Squat Hold: Static hold at bottom position of split squat

Programming Guidelines
    Exercise Selection Principles:
        1. Balance Sagittal and Frontal Plane: Include both anteroposterior and lateral movement patterns
        2. Unilateral Inclusion: Incorporate single-leg work in each training week
        3. Progressive Overload: Systematically increase demand through load, range, volume, or complexity
        4. Hip Extension Emphasis: Prioritize glute-dominant patterns for posterior chain development
        5. Recovery Consideration: Allow 48-72 hours between high-intensity sessions for same movement pattern

    Training Volume Recommendations:
        Strength Focus: 3-5 sets of 3-6 reps at 80-90% intensity
        Hypertrophy Focus: 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps at 65-80% intensity
        Endurance Focus: 2-3 sets of 15-25 reps at 50-65% intensity
        Weekly Volume: 12-20 total sets per movement pattern based on training status

    Exercise Order Strategy:
        Technical/Power First: Begin with most complex/explosive movements (cleans, snatches)
        Compound Multi-Joint: Prioritize largest movement patterns (squats, deadlifts)
        Unilateral Movements: Program after bilateral compound exercises
        Isolation Work: Place hip-specific exercises later in session
        Circuit Integration: Consider lower body/upper body alternating sequences for efficiency
