Specialized Training Methods
    Pre-Exhaustion Techniques:
        Lateral Raise to Overhead Press: Isolation movement immediately followed by compound exercise
        Rear Delt Fly to Row: Pre-fatigue posterior chain before compound pulling movement
        Cable Crossover to Push-Up: Isolate chest fibers before bodyweight compound movement

        Bench Press to Push-Up: Compound weighted movement followed by bodyweight burnout
        Pull-Up to Straight-Arm Pulldown: Compound pull followed by isolated lat activation
        Overhead Press to Front Raise: Pressing movement followed by isolation to maximize deltoid fatigue

    Time Under Tension Methods:
        Tempo Push-Up: Controlled bodyweight movement with prescribed eccentric/concentric timing
        Paused Bench Press: Strategic pauses at various positions during pressing movement
        Slow Eccentric Pull-Up: Emphasis on controlled lowering phase of vertical pulling movement
        Isometric Ring Hold: Static hold positions using gymnastic rings for increased stabilization demand

Programming Guidelines
    Exercise Selection Principles:
        1. Balance Pushing and Pulling: Maintain 1:1 ratio of horizontal and vertical patterns
        2. Rotation Inclusion: Incorporate rotational components at least weekly
        3. Progressive Overload: Systematically increase demand through load, volume, density or complexity
        4. Variation Management: Strategic exercise rotation while maintaining movement patterns
        5. Recovery Consideration: Allow 48-72 hours between high-intensity sessions for same movement pattern

    Training Volume Recommendations:
        Strength Focus: 3-5 sets of 3-6 reps at 80-90% intensity
        Hypertrophy Focus: 3-5 sets of 8-12 reps at 65-80% intensity
        Endurance Focus: 2-3 sets of 15-20+ reps at 50-65% intensity
        Weekly Volume: 10-20 total sets per movement pattern based on training status

    Exercise Order Strategy:
        Power/Technical First: Begin with most complex/explosive movements
        Compound Before Isolation: Prioritize multi-joint before single-joint exercises
        Alternating Push/Pull: Consider antagonist supersets for efficiency
        Rotation Integration: Include rotational elements throughout session
