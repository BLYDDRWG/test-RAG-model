Overhead Squat Assessment

Description
The Overhead Squat Assessment (OSA) is a fundamental movement screen that evaluates 
whole-body mobility, stability, and movement patterns with the arms extended overhead. 
This assessment provides valuable insights into the kinetic chain and reveals compensatory 
movement patterns throughout the body.

Execution Protocol
    Client stands with feet shoulder-width apart
    Arms fully extended overhead, biceps aligned with ears
    Perform 5-10 slow squats to appropriate depth (ideally thighs parallel to floor)
    Observe from anterior, lateral, and posterior views

Use Cases
    Initial Client Screening: Establishes baseline movement capacity
    Program Design: Identifies priority areas for corrective exercise
    Progress Monitoring: Tracks improvements in movement quality
    Injury Prevention: Identifies risk factors before they cause dysfunction
    Return-to-Activity Assessment: Evaluates readiness for progressive loading

Key Observations Through Tensegrity Lens

    Muscle Balance Evaluation
        Feet: Excessive pronation or supination
        Knees: Valgus collapse or lateral tracking
        Lumbo-pelvic: Anterior/posterior tilting
        Thoracic: Limited extension or rotation
        Shoulders: Scapular winging or forward rounding
    Length-Tension Relationships
        Gastrocnemius/soleus complex restrictions (heels rising)
        Hip flexor/hamstring imbalances (excessive lumbar flexion)
        Latissimus dorsi/pectoralis tightness (arms falling forward)
        Upper trapezius dominance vs. lower trap weakness
    Force Coupling Assessment
        Gluteus medius/TFL relationship (hip stability)
        Core synergy between transverse abdominis and multifidus
        Scapular stabilizers coordination (serratus anterior/lower trapezius)

Key Takeaways From Results
    Movement Efficiency Indicators
    Maintains neutral spine throughout movement
    Knees track over toes without collapsing inward
    Arms remain aligned with ears
    Weight distribution balanced through midfoot
    Adequate depth achieved without compensation

Common Compensations and Root Causes

    Feet Turn Out/Heels Rise
        Limited ankle dorsiflexion
        Tight gastrocnemius/soleus complex

    Knees Cave In (Valgus)
        Weak gluteus medius/minimus
        Overactive adductors/TFL
        Poor neuromuscular control

    Excessive Forward Lean
        Tight hip flexors
        Limited thoracic extension
        Weak anterior core

    Arms Fall Forward
        Tight latissimus dorsi/pectorals
        Weak mid/lower trapezius
        Limited thoracic mobility

    Asymmetrical Weight Shift
        Potential structural issues
        Unilateral dysfunction
        Previous injury compensation patterns

Next Steps Based on Results
    Mobility Interventions
        Ankles: Banded ankle mobilizations, calf/soleus stretching
        Hips: 90/90 stretching, hip flexor releases, adductor mobility
        Thoracic: Extension over foam roller, rotation drills, quadruped thoracic rotations
        Shoulders: Pec minor release, latissimus stretching, wall slides
    Stability/Activation Work
        Feet/Ankles: Short foot exercises, single-leg balance progression
        Knees/Hips: Glute activation (clamshells, bridges), hip abduction work
        Core: Dead bugs, bird-dogs, Pallof press variations
        Upper Back: Band pull-aparts, YTWLs, scapular setting exercises

    Movement Pattern Retraining
        Regression Exercises
            Assisted squat patterns (TRX, wall)
            Box squats to controllable depth
            Goblet squat variations

        Integration Drills
            Split-stance movements
            Half-kneeling overhead work
            Farmer's carries with overhead reach

        Progressive Loading
            Bodyweight to external load
            Stable to unstable environments
            Simple to complex movement patterns

By addressing the findings in this systematic approach, trainers can develop targeted 
interventions that respect the tensegrity concept, optimizing joint function and movement 
efficiency for their clients.
