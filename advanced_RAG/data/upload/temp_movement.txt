Movement Quality Development Framework

Assessment-Based Movement Progression
Following a comprehensive assessment, when an individual demonstrates postural, stability, mobility, 
and/or motor control issues, the development of quality movement should follow an evidence-based 
progression framework that is both systematic and adaptable:

    Core Progression Sequence
        The general developmental pathway emphasizes:
            Proximal stability →
            Proximal mobility →
            Distal stability →
            Distal mobility →
            Integrated load-bearing activity

    Implementation Principles
        Individualized Application: Progression is calibrated to the individual's size, age, gender, 
        training history, and specific movement limitations
        Non-Linear Integration: While following the general proximal-to-distal sequence, components 
        may require simultaneous attention—early mobility work may be prerequisite for achieving proper 
        stability in some cases
        Ongoing Reassessment: Regular movement quality reassessment at 2-4 week intervals guides 
        progression decisions and validates effectiveness of interventions
        Neural Adaptation Focus: Each stage emphasizes not only mechanical tissue changes but also 
        neurological adaptations including motor pattern recruitment, coordination efficiency, and 
        proprioceptive awareness
        Regional Interdependence: Recognizes that dysfunction in one area creates compensatory patterns 
        throughout the kinetic chain, requiring a holistic approach rather than isolated interventions
        Clear Progression Criteria: Advancement between stages is based on demonstrable competency rather 
        than arbitrary timeframes—quality of movement determines readiness for progression

    Desired Outcomes
        This framework systematically develops and reinforces:
            Balanced strength appropriate to individual requirements
            Functional mobility (ability to generate appropriate force through complete ROM)
            Enhanced proprioception (body awareness and movement control)
            Optimal tensegrity (efficient load distribution and force transfer throughout interconnected systems)
            Application Context

This framework serves as a guiding principle rather than rigid protocol, allowing for clinical reasoning 
and adaptation based on individual response, specific movement demands, and rehabilitation goals.
