Mobility Development Protocol
General Mobility Framework
Mobility represents a critical element of movement quality, defined as the ability to actively achieve optimal 
range of motion through a joint or series of joints during functional movements.

True mobility encompasses:
    Active control: Ability to actively produce and control movement through full ranges
    Tissue extensibility: Appropriate length and compliance of myofascial tissues
    Neuromuscular freedom: Reduced neural restrictions and movement hesitancy
    Articular health: Optimal joint surface relationships and synovial fluid dynamics

This protocol divides the body into three interconnected yet distinct mobility systems, each requiring targeted development.

Shoulder Girdle Mobility Protocol
    Key Mobility Principles
    Thoracic extension underpins optimal shoulder elevation
    Scapular mobility precedes glenohumeral range development
    Capsular patterns must be addressed differently than muscular restrictions
    Rotational capacities determine overhead function quality
    Protraction/retraction balance impacts anterior/posterior chain mobility
